# Notes/Answers for Haskell Programming from First Principles

Just a place to keep track of my progress on the above book in Git so I can have it on
all the computers I work on.

## Format

The notes are written as Org-mode files with the code written inline and executed via babel

## References

This is pretty far over my head, so I'm using the following resources all written by people
much smarter than me to help me understand it:
