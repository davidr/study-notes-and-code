* Multiple Choice

** The Eq class
   (c) makes equality tests possible

** The typeclass Ord
(c) is a subclass of Eq

** Suppose the typeclass Ord has an operator >. What is the type of >?
(a) Ord a => a -> a -> Bool

** In x = divMod 16 12
(c) the type of x is a tuple

** The typeclass Integral includes
(b) integral, real, and fractional numbers

* Does it typecheck?

** 1
Given:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Person = Person Bool

printPerson :: Person -> IO ()
printPerson person = putStrLn (show person)
#+END_SRC

Fixed:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Person = Person Bool deriving Show

printPerson :: Person -> IO ()
printPerson person = putStrLn (show person)
#+END_SRC

** 2

Given:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Mood = Blah
          | Woot deriving Show

settleDown x = if x == Woot
                 then Blah
                 else x
#+END_SRC

Because settleDown is of type Mood -> Mood, and tests argument equality, Mood must implement Eq

Fixed:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Mood = Blah
          | Woot deriving (Show, Eq)

settleDown x = if x == Woot
                 then Blah
                 else x
#+END_SRC

** 3

- only Mood is an acceptable input
- settleDown 9 will give a type error because Mood does not implement Num (not sure I understand)
- Blah > Woot will give a type error because Mood does not implement Ord
** 4

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
type Subject = String
type Verb = String
type Object = String

data Sentence =
  Sentence Subject Verb Object
  deriving (Eq, Show)

s1 = Sentence "dogs" "drool"
s2 = Sentence "Julie" "loves" "dogs"
#+END_SRC
